# NestJs Fastify Architecture with all security measures

I have created Netjs Application with Fasity I have implement Below thing.
   <br>
	 <ul>
	<li><b>Helmet</b> :
Helmet can help protect your app from some well-known web vulnerabilities by setting HTTP headers appropriately. Generally, Helmet is just a collection of 14 smaller middleware functions that set security-related HTTP header </li>
	<li><b>CORS</b> :Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows resources to be requested from another domain. Under the hood, Nest makes use of the Express cors package. This package provides various options that you can customize based on your requirements.

 </li>
	<li><b>CSRF Protection</b> :Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF or XSRF) is a type of malicious exploit of a website where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts. To mitigate this kind of attack you can use the csurf package.

 </li>
	<li><b>Configuration</b> :
Applications often run in different environments. Depending on the environment, different configuration settings should be used.

 </li>
	<li><b>Logger</b> :
        We used Winston for creating log and store log in file.

 </li>
	<li><b>Guards</b></li>
	<li><b>Interceptors</b></li>
	<li><b>Swagger</b></li>
	 <ul>
